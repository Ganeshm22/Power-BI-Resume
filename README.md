# Power-BI-Resume
As a data analyst, I believe in the power of data visualization. So, I've taken my resume to the next level by turning it into an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

Here's a quick tour of what you'll find in my resume:

Name, Hobbies, Education, Work Experience: I've used text boxes to present this information in a clean and organized way.

Skills vs. Proficiency: Check out the horizontal clustered chart to see my proficiency level in various skills.

Certifications: Use the slicer to filter certifications and see my credentials.

Projects: Each project is represented in a card for a quick overview.

Blog and Articles: Find my latest writings in a table format.
